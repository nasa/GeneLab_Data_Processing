# GeneLab_Data_Processing

## About
The [NASA GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) Data Processing team and [Analysis Working Group](https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg/charter) members have created standard pipelines for processing omics data from spaceflight and space-relevant experiments. This repository contains the processing pipelines that have been standardized to date for the assay types indicated below. Each subdirectory in this repository holds current and previous pipeline versions for the respective assay type, including detailed descriptions and processing instructions as well as the exact processing commands used to generate processed data for datasets hosted in the [GeneLab Data Repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).

## Usage
We encourage all investigators working with space-relevant omics data to process their data using the standard pipelines described here when possible. Anyone planning to publish analyses derived from [GeneLab processed data](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) may refer to this repository for data processing methods. If you have omics data from a spaceflight or space-relevant experiment, you can submit your data to GeneLab through our [submission portal](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/geode-sso-login/).
