# GeneLab removal of human reads from metagenomics datasets

> **It is NASA's policy that any human reads are to be removed from metagenomics datasets prior to being hosted in [GeneLab's data repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects). As such, all metagenomics datasets are screened against a human reference-genome [kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki) database. This document holds an overview and some example code of how GeneLab does performs this.**

## 1. Build kraken2 database

```bash
kraken2-build --download-taxonomy --db kraken2-human-db/
kraken2-build --download-library human --db kraken2-human-db --threads 12
kraken2-build --build --db kraken2-human-db/ --threads 12 --minimizer-spaces 6
kraken2-build --clean --db kraken2-human-db/
```

**Parameter Definitions:**

* `--download-library` - specifies the references to download (here just the human reference genome)
* `--db` - specifies the directory we are putting the database in
* `--threads` - specifies the number of threads to use
* `--download-taxonomy` - downloads taxonomic mapping information
* `--build` - specifies to construct kraken2-formatted database
* `--minimizer-spaces` – specifies the number of positions in the minimizer that will be masked out during all comparisons; must be fewer than the minimizer-len divided by 4
* `--clean` - specifies to remove unnecessarily intermediate files

**Input data:**

* None

**Output data:**

* kraken2 database files (hash.k2d, opts.k2d, and taxo.k2d)

## 2. Filter out human-classified reads

### Example if paired-end reads

```bash
kraken2 --db kraken2-human-db --gzip-compressed --threads 4 --use-names --paired \
        --output sample-1-kraken2-output.txt --report sample-1-kraken2-report.tsv \
        --unclassified-out sample-1_R#.fastq sample-1-R1.fq.gz sample-1-R2.fq.gz
```

**Parameter Definitions:**

* `--db` - specifies the directory holding the kraken2 database files created in step 1
* `--gzip-compressed` - specifies the input fastq files are gzip-compressed
* `--threads` - specifies the number of threads to use
* `--use-names` - specifies adding taxa names in addition to taxids
* `--paired` - specifies input reads are paired-end
* `--output` - specifies the name of the kraken2 read-based output file (one line per read)
* `--report` - specifies the name of the kraken2 report output file (one line per taxa, with number of reads assigned to it)
* `--unclassified-out` - name of output files of reads that were not classified (the `#` symbol gets replaced with "_1" and "_2" in the output file names)
* last two positional arguments are the input read files

**Input data:**

* sample-1-R1.fq.gz (gzipped forward-reads fastq file)
* sample-1-R2.fq.gz (gzipped reverse-reads fastq file)

**Output data:**

* sample-1-kraken2-output.txt (kraken2 read-based output file (one line per read))
* sample-1-kraken2-report.tsv (kraken2 report output file (one line per taxa, with number of reads assigned to it))
* sample-1_R_1.fastq (human-read removed, forward reads fastq file)
* sample-1_R_2.fastq (human-read removed, reverse reads fastq file)

### Example if single-end reads

```bash
kraken2 --db kraken2-human-db --gzip-compressed --threads 4 --use-names \
        --output sample-1-kraken2-output.txt --report sample-1-kraken2-report.tsv \
        --unclassified-out sample-1.fastq sample-1_R1.fq.gz
```

**Parameter Definitions:**

* `--db` - specifies the directory holding the kraken2 database files created in step 1
* `--gzip-compressed` - specifies the input fastq files are gzip-compressed
* `--threads` - specifies the number of threads to use
* `--use-names` - specifies adding taxa names in addition to taxids
* `--output` - specifies the name of the kraken2 read-based output file (one line per read)
* `--report` - specifies the name of the kraken2 report output file (one line per taxa, with number of reads assigned to it)
* `--unclassified-out` - name of output file of reads that were not classified 
* last positional argument is the input read file

**Input data:**

* sample-1_R1.fq.gz (gzipped reads fastq file)

**Output data:**

* sample-1-kraken2-output.txt (kraken2 read-based output file (one line per read))
* sample-1-kraken2-report.tsv (kraken2 report output file (one line per taxa, with number of reads assigned to it))
* sample-1.fastq (human-read removed, reads fastq file)

## 3. Generate a kraken2 summary report
Utilizes a Unix-like command-line.

```bash
total_fragments=$(wc -l sample-1-kraken2-output.txt | cut -f 1 -d " ")

fragments_retained=$(grep -w -m 1 "unclassified" sample-1-kraken2-report.tsv | cut -f 2)

perc_removed=$(printf "%.2f\n" $(echo "scale=4; 100 - ${fragments_retained} / ${total_fragments} * 100" | bc -l))

cat <( printf "Sample_ID\tTotal_fragments_before\tTotal_fragments_after\tPercent_human_reads_removed\n" ) \
    <( printf "Sample-1\t${total_fragments}\t${fragments_retained}\t${perc_removed}\n" ) > Human-read-removal-summary.tsv
```

**Input data:**

* sample-1-kraken2-output.txt (kraken2 read-based output file (one line per read))
* sample-1-kraken2-report.tsv (kraken2 report output file (one line per taxa, with number of reads assigned to it))

**Output data:**

* Human-read-removal-summary.tsv (a tab-separated file with 4 columns: "Sample_ID", "Total_fragments_before", "Total_fragments_after", "Percent_human_reads_removed")
