# GeneLab Workflow Information for Estimating Host Reads in Illumina Metagenomics Seq Data

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the estimating host DNA in Illumina metagenomics sequencing data pipeline (MGEstHostReads) into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each MGEstHostReads version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current MGEstHostReads/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage.
