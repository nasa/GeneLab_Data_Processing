# GeneLab pipeline for estimating host reads in metagenomics sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7109-A.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7109_Versions/GL-DPPD-7109-A.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab identifies and provides an estimate of host DNA in metagenomics sequencing datasets that are sequenced from host-derived samples. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. The percentage of detected host reads and a GeneLab host read estimation summary are provided for each GLDS dataset in the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).**  
> 
> Note: The exact host read identification commands and MGEstHostReads version used for specific GLDS datasets can be found in the *_processing_info.tar file under "Study Files" for each respective GLDS dataset in the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).
