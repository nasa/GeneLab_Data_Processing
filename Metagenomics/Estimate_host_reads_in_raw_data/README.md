# GeneLab pipeline for estimating host reads in Illumina metagenomics sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7109.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7109_Versions/GL-DPPD-7109.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab identifies and provides an estimate of host DNA in Illumina metagenomics sequencing datasets that are sequenced from host-derived samples. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. The percentage of detected host reads and a GeneLab host-read estimation summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
