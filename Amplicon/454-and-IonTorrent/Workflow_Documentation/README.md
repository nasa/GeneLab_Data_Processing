# GeneLab 454 and IonTorrent Amplicon Seq Workflow Information

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the 454 and IonTorrent amplicon sequencing data processing pipeline (Amp454IonTor) into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each Amp454IonTor version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current Amp454IonTor/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and Amp454IonTor version used to process specific datasets that have been released are provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
