# GeneLab Illumina Amplicon Seq Workflow Information

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the Illumina amplicon sequencing data processing pipeline (AmpIllumina), starting with pipeline version A, into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each AmpIllumina version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current AmpIllumina pipeline/workflow implementation is indicated. The workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and AmpIllumina version used to process specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](../GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory and/or are provided with their processed data in the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).**
