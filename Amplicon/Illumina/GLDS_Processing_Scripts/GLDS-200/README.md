# GeneLab processing commands for GLDS-200

This dataset was processed with [GL-DPPD-7104-A](../../GL-DPPD-7104-A.md).

The raw and processed data are available from: [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-200/](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-200/)

The [full-command-line-log.sh](full-command-line-log.sh) file holds all commands as the processing was performed, which calls the two R scripts [16S-full-R-processing.R](16S-full-R-processing.R) and [ITS-full-R-processing.R](ITS-full-R-processing.R).
