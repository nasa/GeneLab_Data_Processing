# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for Illumina amplicon sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7104-A.md`](GL-DPPD-7104-A.md) holds an overview and instructions for how GeneLab processes Illumina amplicon datasets. Exact processing commands for specific datasets that have been released is available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory and is also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
