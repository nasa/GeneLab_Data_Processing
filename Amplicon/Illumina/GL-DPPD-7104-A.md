## 2. Trim Primers  

The location and orientation of primers in the data is important to understand in deciding how to do this step. `cutadapt` has many options for primer identification and removal. They are described in detail on their documentation page here: [https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#adapter-types](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#adapter-types)  

The following example commands show how it was done for some samples of [GLDS-200](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-200/), which was 2x250 sequencing of the 16S gene using these primers:  
* forward: 5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3’  
* reverse: 5’-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3’  

Due to the size of the target amplicon and the type of sequencing done here, both forward and reverse primers are expected to be on each of the forward and reverse reads. It therefore takes “linked” primers as input for forward and reverse reads, specified above by the `...` between them. It also expects that the primers start at the first position of the reads (“anchored”), specified with the leading `^` characters.  

The following website is useful for reverse complementing primers and dealing with degenerate bases appropriately: [http://arep.med.harvard.edu/labgc/adnan/projects/Utilities/revcomp.html](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/labgc/adnan/projects/Utilities/revcomp.html)  

```
cutadapt -a ^GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA...ATTAGATACCCSBGTAGTCC -A ^GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT...TTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC \
         ## Define what B represents; and define what K represents ##
         -o Primer-trimmed-R1.fq.gz -p Primer-trimmed-R2.fq.gz Input_R1_raw.fastq.gz Input_R2_raw.fastq.gz \
         --discard-untrimmed
```

**Parameter Definitions:**

*	`-a` – specifies the primers and orientations expected on the forward reads (when primers are linked as noted above)

*	`-A` – specifies the primers and orientations expected on the reverse reads (when primers are linked as noted above)

*	`-o` – specifies output of forward, primer-trimmed reads

*	`-p` – specifies output of reverse, primer-trimmed reads

-	`Input_R1_raw.fastq.gz` – this and following “R2” version are positional arguments specifying the forward and reverse reads, respectively, for input

-	`--discard-untrimmed` – this filters out those reads? where the primers were not found as expected

**Input Data:**

* fastq, compressed or uncompressed (original reads)

**Output Data:**

* fastq, compressed or uncompressed (trimmed reads)
* tsv (per sample read counts before and after trimming)
* log (log file of standard output and error from cutadapt)

## 3. Quality filtering
> The following is run in an R environment.  

Specific settings required will depend on the dataset being processing. These include parameters such as `truncLen`, which might depend on the target amplicon and its size, and `maxEE` which might depend on the quality of the sequencing run. For instance, when working with ITS data, it may be preferable to omit using the `truncLen` parameter if the target amplified region is expected to vary to lengths greater than the read size. More information on these parameters can be found at these sites:  
* [https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html)  
* [https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex](https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex)  


The following is an example from a [GLDS-200](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-200/) sample that used paired-end 2x250 sequencing with the following 16S primers:  
* forward: 5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3’
* reverse: 5’- GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3’

```
filtered_out <- filterAndTrim(fwd=“Primer-trimmed-R1.fq.gz”, filt=“Filtered-R1.fq.gz”,
                              rev=“Primer-trimmed-R2.fq.gz”, filt.rev=“Filtered-R2.fq.gz”,
                              truncLen=c(220, 160), maxN=0, maxEE=c(2,2),
                              truncQ=2, rm.phix=TRUE, compress=TRUE, multithread=TRUE)
```

*	`truncLen=c(220, 160)` – specifying the forward reads to be truncated at 220 bp, and the reverse to be truncated at 160 bps (note that this parameter also functions as a minimum-length filter); would only have 1 value if not paired-end

*	`maxN=0` – setting the maximum allowed Ns to 0, any reads with an N will be filtered out

*	`maxEE=c(2,2)` – setting maximum expected error allowed to 2 for each forward and reverse read; would only have 1 value if not paired-end

*	`truncQ=2` – looking from the lower-quality end of each read, truncate at the first base with a quality score lower than 2

*	`rm.phix=TRUE` – filter out reads with exact kmers matching the PhiX genome

*	`compress=TRUE` – gzip-compress the output filtered reads

*	`multithread=TRUE` – determine number of cores available and run in parallel when possible (can also take an integer specifying the number to run)

## 5. Calculate error model, apply DADA2 algorithm, assign taxonomy, and create output tables
> The following is run in an R environment.  

These example commands as written assumes paired-end data, with notes included on what would be different if working with single-end data. The taxonomy reference database used below is as an example only, suitable for the example 16S dataset ([GLDS-200](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-200/)) used here. But others designed for DECIPHER can be found here: [http://www2.decipher.codes/Downloads.html](http://www2.decipher.codes/Downloads.html)

<br>

### Generating and writing standard outputs

Giving sequences more manageable names (e.g. ASV_1, ASV_2, …,):
```R
asv_seqs <- colnames(seqtab.nochim)
asv_headers <- vector(dim(seqtab.nochim)[2], mode="character")

for (i in 1:dim(seqtab.nochim)[2]) {
  asv_headers[i] <- paste(">ASV", i, sep="_")
}
```

Making then writing a fasta of final ASV seqs:
```R
asv_fasta <- c(rbind(asv_headers, asv_seqs))
write(asv_fasta, "ASVs.fa")
```

Making then writing a count table:
```R
asv_tab <- t(seqtab.nochim)
row.names(asv_tab) <- sub(">", "", asv_headers)

write.table(asv_tab, "ASVs_counts.tsv", sep="\t", quote=F, col.names=NA)
```

Creating table of taxonomy and setting any that are unclassified as "NA":
```R
ranks <- c("domain", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus", "species")
tax_tab <- t(sapply(tax_info, function(x) {
  m <- match(ranks, x$rank)
  taxa <- x$taxon[m]
  taxa[startsWith(taxa, "unclassified_")] <- NA
  taxa
}))
colnames(tax_tab) <- ranks
rownames(tax_tab) <- gsub(pattern=">", replacement="", x=asv_headers)

write.table(tax_tab, "Taxonomy.tsv", sep = "\t", quote=F, col.names=NA)
```

Generating then writing biom file format:
```R
biom_object <- make_biom(data=asv_tab, observation_metadata=tax_tab)
write_biom(biom_object, "Taxonomy_and_counts.biom")
```

Making a combined taxonomy and count table
```R
tax_and_count_tab <- merge(tax_tab, asv_tab)
write.table(tax_and_count_tab, "Taxonomy_and_counts.tsv", sep="\t", quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE)
```

**Input Data:**

* fastq, compressed or uncompressed (filtered reads)

**Output Data:**

* fasta (inferred sequences)
* count_table.tsv (count table)
* taxonomy_table.tsv (taxonomy table)
* taxonomy_and_counts.tsv (combined taxonomy and count table)
* biom (count and taxonomy table in biom format)
* read_count_tracking.tsv (read counts at each processing step)
