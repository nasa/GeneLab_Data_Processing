# GeneLab Microarray Agilent 1-channel (NF_MAAgilent1ch) Workflow Information

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the pipeline into a workflow with validation and verification of output files built in after each step. The table below lists (and links to) each NF_MAAgilent1ch version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current NF_MAAgilent1ch/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and NF_MAAgilent1ch version used to process specific datasets that have been released are available in the \*nextflow_processing_info.txt file on the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/), which can be found under 'Files' -> 'GeneLab Processed RNA-Seq Files' -> 'Supplemental Materials'.**
