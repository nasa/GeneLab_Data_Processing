  Default behaviour is as follows:
  - If accessions are not set, then either runsheet or an ISA Archive MUST be supplied
  - If both accessions are set:
    - If runsheet and ISA archive are left unset, then the ISA archive will be fetched from the GeneLab API and runsheet generated from the runsheet.
    - If either runsheet or ISA archive are set, they will be used but the output directory and tags will reflect the appropriate accessions.  This is useful when processing from the OSDR but OSDR metadata is not ready as is.
    - If both runsheet and ISA archive are set, the workflow will halt.
  - If only one accession is set, then the workflow will halt.
