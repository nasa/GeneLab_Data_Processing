# NF_MAAffymetrix Workflow Information and Usage Instructions <!-- omit in toc -->

## General Workflow Info <!-- omit in toc -->

### Implementation Tools <!-- omit in toc -->

The current GeneLab Affymetrix Microarray consensus processing pipeline (NF_MAAffymetrix), [GL-DPPD-7114](../../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md), is implemented as a [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow and utilizes [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/introduction.html) to run all tools in containers. This workflow (NF_MAAffymetrix) is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system.  While knowledge of creating workflows in Nextflow is not required to run the workflow as is, [the Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow.   

### Workflow & Subworkflows <!-- omit in toc -->

---

<!-- TODO Add workflow image -->

---
The NF_MAAffymetrix workflow is composed of three subworkflows as shown in the image above.
Below is a description of each subworkflow and the additional output files generated that are not already indicated in the [GL-DPPD-7114 pipeline 
document](../../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md):

1. **Analysis Staging Subworkflow**

   - Description:
     - This subworkflow extracts the metadata parameters (e.g. organism, Array Design REF) needed for processing from the OSD/GLDS ISA archive and retrieves the raw reads files hosted on the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).
       > *OSD/GLDS ISA archive*: ISA directory containing Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) metadata files for a respective GLDS dataset - the *ISA.zip file is located in the [OSDR](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/) under 'Files' -> 'Study Metadata Files' for any GeneLab Data Set (GLDS) in the OSDR.

2. **Affymetrix Microarray Processing Subworkflow**

   - Description:
     - This subworkflow uses the staged raw data and metadata parameters from the Analysis Staging Subworkflow to generate processed data using the [GL-DPPD-7114 pipeline](../../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md).

1. **V&V Pipeline Subworkflow**

   - Description:
     - This subworkflow performs validation and verification (V&V) on the raw and processed data files.  It performs a series of checks on the output files generated and flags the results, using the flag codes indicated in the table below, which are outputted into a log file.  
       **V&V Flags**:

       |Flag Codes|Flag Name|Interpretation|
       |:---------|:--------|:-------------|
       | 2    | MANUAL   | Special flag that indicates a manual check that is advised. Often used to advise what should be visually assessed in QA plots. |
       | 20    | GREEN   | Indicates the check passed all validation conditions |
       | 30    | YELLOW  | Indicates the check was flagged for minor issues (e.g. slight outliers) |
       | 50    | RED     | Indicates the check was flagged for moderate issues (e.g. major outliers) |
       | 80    | HALT    | Indicates the check was flagged for severe issues that trigger a processing halt (e.g. missing data) |

### 1. Install Nextflow and Singularity 

#### 1a. Install Nextflow

Nextflow can be installed either through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextflow) or as documented on the [Nextflow documentation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html).

> Note: If you want to install Anaconda, we recommend installing a Miniconda, Python3 version appropriate for your system, as instructed by [Happy Belly Bioinformatics](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/conda-intro#getting-and-installing-conda).  
> 
> Once conda is installed on your system, you can install the latest version of Nextflow by running the following commands:
> 
> ```bash
> conda install -c bioconda nextflow
> nextflow self-update
> ```

<br>

#### 1b. Install Singularity

Singularity is a container platform that allows usage of containerized software. This enables the GeneLab NF_MAAffymetrix workflow to retrieve and use all software required for processing without the need to install the software directly on the user's system.

We recommend installing Singularity on a system wide level as per the associated [documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html).

> Note: Singularity is also available through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/singularity).

<br>

### 2. Download the Workflow Files

All files required for utilizing the NF_MAAffymetrix GeneLab workflow for processing Affymetrix Microarray data are in the [workflow_code](workflow_code) directory. To get a 
copy of latest NF_MAAffymetrix version on to your system, the code can be downloaded as a zip file from the release page then unzipped after downloading by running the following commands: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/releases/download/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4.zip

unzip NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4.zip
```

<br>

---

### 3. Run the Workflow

While in the location containing the `NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files), you are now able to run the workflow. Below are three examples of how to run the NF_MAAffymetrix workflow:
> Note: Nextflow commands use both single hyphen arguments (e.g. -help) that denote general nextflow arguments and double hyphen arguments (e.g. --ensemblVersion) that denote workflow specific parameters.  Take care to use the proper number of hyphens for each argument.

<br>

#### 3a. Approach 1: Run the workflow on a GeneLab Affymetrix Microarray dataset

```bash
nextflow run NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity \
   --osdAccession OSD-266 \
   --gldsAccession GLDS-266 
```

<br>

#### 3b. Approach 2: Run the workflow on a non-GLDS dataset using a user-created runsheet

> Note: Specifications for creating a runsheet manually are described [here](examples/runsheet/README.md).

```bash
nextflow run NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity \
   --runsheetPath </path/to/runsheet> 
```

<br>

#### 3c. Approach 3: Run the workflow using an ISA Archive

> Note: Specifications for the ISA Tab Archive format can be found [here](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isatab.html).

```bash
nextflow run NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity \
   --isaArchivePath </path/to/isaArchive> 
```

<br>

**Required Parameters For All Approaches:**

* `NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/main.nf` - Instructs Nextflow to run the NF_MAAffymetrix workflow 

* `-profile` - Specifies the configuration profile(s) to load, `singularity` instructs Nextflow to setup and use singularity for all software called in the workflow


<br>

**Additional Required Parameters For [Approach 1](#3a-approach-1-run-the-workflow-on-a-genelab-agilent-1-channel-microarray-dataset):**

* `--osdAccession OSD-###` – specifies the OSD ID to process through the NF_MAAffymetrix workflow (replace ### with the OSD number)

* `--gldsAccession GLDS-###` – specifies the GLDS ID to process through the NF_MAAffymetrix workflow (replace ### with the GLDS number)  

<br>

**Additional Required Parameters For [Approach 2](#3b-approach-2-run-the-workflow-on-a-non-glds-dataset-using-a-user-created-runsheet):**

* `--runsheetPath` - specifies the path to a local runsheet (Default: a runsheet is automatically generated using the metadata on the GeneLab Repository for the GLDS dataset being processed) 

<br>

**Optional Parameters:**

* `--skipVV` - skip the automated V&V processes (Default: the automated V&V processes are active) 

* `--resultsDir` - specifies the output directory for all files produced by the workflow (Default: <OSD-NNN_GLDS-NNN> if OSD and GLDS accessions are specified.  Otherwise, the workflow launch directory.) 

<br>

All parameters listed above and additional optional arguments for the NF_MAAffymetrix workflow, including debug related options that may not be immediately useful for most users, can be viewed by running the following command:

```bash
nextflow run NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/main.nf --help
```

See `nextflow run -h` and [Nextflow's CLI run command documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#run) for more options and details common to all nextflow workflows.
