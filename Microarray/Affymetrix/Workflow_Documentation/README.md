# GeneLab RNAseq Workflow Information

> ** For the processing pipeline for Affymetrix microarray data,
[`GL-DPPD-7114.md`](../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md),
GeneLab has wrapped each step of the pipeline into a workflow with validation and verification of output files built in after each step. The table below lists (and links to) each NF_MAAffymetrix version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current NF_MAAffymetrix/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage.**
