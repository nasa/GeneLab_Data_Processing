# GeneLab RNAseq Workflow Information

> **Starting with version F of the GeneLab RNA-seq consensus processing pipeline (RCP),
[`GL-DPPD-7101-F.md`](../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md),
GeneLab has wrapped each step of the pipeline into a workflow with validation and verification of output files built in after each step. The table below lists (and links to) each RCP version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current RCP/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and RCP version used to process specific datasets that have been released are available in the \*nextflow_processing_info.txt file on the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/), which can be found under 'Files' -> 'GeneLab Processed RNA-Seq Files' -> 'Supplemental Materials'.**
