        # this entry denotes the following:
        # retrive from that ISA field name
        # multiple values (separated by ",")
        # index those to certain runsheet columns
        # if the index doesn't exist, optional prevents raising an exception
        # GLDS URL Mapping means the names are searched against the GLDS filelisting json for urls
        # an exception will be raised if one and only one url is not mapped to each filename

            The location of either the forward reads (paired end) or only reads file (single end) 
            raw fastq file. Can be either a url or local path.
            Note: For GLDS raw data assets, either the filelisting json API or the OpenAPI
            may be used to retrieve urls given the array data filename (sourced from ISA archive).
          Example: /some/local/path OR https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/static/media/dataset/GLDS-123_microarray_E-MTAB-3289.raw.1.zip?version=1

            raw fastq file. Can be either a url or local path.
            For single end studies, this should be an empty string.
            Note: For GLDS raw data assets, either the filelisting json API or the OpenAPI
            may be used to retrieve urls given the array data filename (sourced from ISA archive).
