# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipelines for Illumina RNA-sequencing data

> **Documents [`GL-DPPD-7101-G.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md) and [`GL-DPPD-7115`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7115_Versions) contain overview and example commands for how GeneLab processes RNAseq datasets from eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, respectively. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. Processed data output files and a GeneLab data processing summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).**
