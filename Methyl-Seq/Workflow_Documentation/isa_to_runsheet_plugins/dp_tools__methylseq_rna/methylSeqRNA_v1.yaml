          Processing Usage: >-
            The location of either the forward reads (paired end) or only reads file (single end) 
            raw fastq file. Can be either a url or local path.
            Note: For GLDS raw data assets, either the filelisting json API or the OpenAPI
            may be used to retrieve urls given the sequencing data filename (sourced from ISA archive).
          Example: /some/local/path OR https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/geode-py/ws/studies/OSD-{number}/download?source=datamanager&file={filename_R1}
    
  
        - Runsheet Column Name: read2_path
          Data Asset Keys: ["raw reverse reads fastq GZ"]
          Processing Usage: >-
            The location of either the reverse reads (paired end)
            raw fastq file. Can be either a url or local path.
            For single end studies, this should be an empty string.
            Note: For GLDS raw data assets, either the filelisting json API or the OpenAPI
            may be used to retrieve urls given the sequencing data filename (sourced from ISA archive).
